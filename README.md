# HDL_Verilog
A growing collection of digital design projects using Verilog HDL, built with curiosity, precision, and a passion for hardware systems.

## 🔢 4-bit Arithmetic Unit
### 📌 Summary
Designed a 4-bit arithmetic unit to support 8 micro-operations based on a 3-bit opcode. The system uses 4×1 multiplexers and full adders to perform:
>Add / Add with Carry/n
>Subtract / Subtract with Borrow/
>Increment / Decrement/
>Transfer A

### 📈 Simulation Highlight
Example: Opcode 001 triggers Add with Carry (A + B + 1).
Waveform confirms expected output: D = 0b11010 ✔️
