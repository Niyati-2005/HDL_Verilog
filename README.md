# ðŸ§  HDL_Verilog

A growing collection of digital design projects using Verilog HDL â€” driven by curiosity, precision, and a passion for hardware systems.
# ðŸ”¢ 4-bit Arithmetic Unit
## ðŸ“Œ Summary

A 4-bit Arithmetic Unit designed to perform eight micro-operations based on a 3-bit opcode. The system is built using 4Ã—1 multiplexers and full adders, supporting the following operations:

    Addition

    Addition with Carry

    Subtraction

    Subtraction with Borrow

    Increment

    Decrement

    Transfer A

    Clear (Optional or NOP)

    This unit serves as a fundamental component in understanding ALU operations at a structural level.
